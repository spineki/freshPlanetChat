# CODING TEST: PART 1

## RUNNING THE APP
To avoid port conflict between my tests and my running demon, the main app runs under `ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:5000/graphql` (notice port 5000).

You can run this project with `yarn install` to install the dependencies and then `yarn run start` or `yarn run demon`

## Note on authentification
Authentification was supposed to be already effective. Thus, I added in apollo Server configuration a context callback that will automatically log you as "user2". In a real production context, a complete authentification system, using jwt, etc, should be used instead.

## Assumptions and choices:
- The term "forums" will be used instead of "fora" because it better matches the list naming convention (adding an "s" at the end)
- Two forums cannot have the same name. This allows forum creation to use names to verify if the forum already exists.
- Since a database wasn't required, I directly load a `.json` file in the server memory. Data is modified directly by a mutation resolver. The code is thus longer than it would have been with database queries. For example, I have to generate a new ID by hand when a forum is added to the "database".
- SendingTime is computed server-side. This way, we simplify client mutation queries, we simplify time zone handling, we prevent users from sending a message to prior times (thus modifying chat history), and messages are already stored in order.
- I decided to implement a pagination system for messages. I could have gone for an offset system, but cursor-based pagination is now a "best practice" and allows more flexibility. Even though cursors usually are strings, an Int is enough because of the messages data structure.


## Extra Packages
Except for linters and prettier, and ts-dev (faster than nodemon), I did not use any extra package

## Tests:

I added several tests in the tests folder. They ensure that every requirement of the specs is fulfilled. I'm using jest so you can run `yarn run test` or `npm run test` to check that everything is working well.

## Github Actions
A `.github` folder can be found at the root of the project. A `yml` configuration file inside runs whenever this branch is pushed. Jest action launches the test files. Thus, we can quickly verify that integration is not broken. (CI)

## SCHEMA

The following schema is taken from the inspector page available thanks to the apollo server.
I provide below the full retrieved schema, but 
- directive @cacheControl
- CacheControlScope
- Upload

are not shown here because they were automatically created by apollo. (The SDL file can be found under `src/schema/type-defs.ts`)
